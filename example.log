[03/06/2003, 14:04:32] John: Mark I've got a problem, do you have a moment?
[03/06/2003, 14:05:10] John: Mark?
[03/06/2003, 14:05:45] John: Hellooooo
[03/06/2003, 14:06:22] Mark: Hi John, what's going on?
[03/06/2003, 14:06:30] John: My PC is acting up
[03/06/2003, 14:06:44] John: Can I bring it by in like an hour?
[03/06/2003, 14:07:01] Mark: Yeah that's okay.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:05] John: Nice weather lately.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:10] Mark: Sure is! But they say it might rain next week.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:23] John: I heard that, too. Still, like my grandma used to say, itâ€™ll be good for the flowers.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:34] Mark: Definitely. I'm thinking of entering my dahlias in the Spring Spectacular in May.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:45] John: That's fantastic! I hope you win. I'll be doing my unicycle juggling at the talent show that same weekend.
[14/11/2009, 17:23:57] Mark: Really? I've tried to learn juggling, but I can't get past two grapefruit.
[14/11/2009, 17:24:12] John: Maybe you should try oranges. Sometimes smaller things are easier to handle.
[14/11/2009, 17:24:22] Mark: Great idea. I'll go get some right now. Thanks!
[14/11/2009, 17:24:27] John: You're welcome. Have a nice day!
[14/11/2009, 17:23:33] Mark: You too! Bye
[01/12/2018, 18:49:45] John: Hello, Mark
[01/12/2018, 18:49:55] John: Could you help me do the password reset, please?
[01/12/2018, 18:50:04] Mark: Sure thing, John.
[01/12/2018, 18:50:09] Mark: Do you have your e-mail address for me?
[01/12/2018, 18:50:16] John: It's john@example.com
[01/12/2018, 18:50:20] Mark: Thanks. A moment please.
[01/12/2018, 18:51:02] Mark: I've just sent you a confirmation email, John.
[01/12/2018, 18:51:10] John: Ok.
[01/12/2018, 18:51:45] John: I have not received anything yet.
[01/12/2018, 18:51:53] Mark: Are you sure your e-mail address is john@example.com?
[01/12/2018, 18:52:12] John: Sorry. That's not the one I used to sign up.
[01/12/2018, 18:52:30] John: it's john.doe@example.com
[01/12/2018, 18:52:55] Mark: I've sent you another email.
[01/12/2018, 18:54:40] Mark: Have you received my email, John?
[01/12/2018, 18:54:51] John: I was able to reset my password.
[01/12/2018, 18:55:00] John: Thanks for the help.
[01/12/2018, 18:55:07] Mark: My pleasure. Have a good day.
[08/12/2018, 13:44:22] John: Hello, how are you?
[08/12/2018, 13:44:30] Mark: Hi, pretty good, thanks. And you?
[08/12/2018, 13:44:38] John: I'm good thanks, beautiful day today?
[08/12/2018, 13:44:57] Mark: You're not wrong, it's magic out there.
[08/12/2018, 13:45:04] John: Think I might head off camping this afternoon.
[08/12/2018, 13:45:11] Mark: Man that would be awesome, where do you go camping?
[08/12/2018, 13:45:31] John: We're heading up to Barrington, we love the river up there.
[08/12/2018, 13:45:47] Mark: Yes, I went there before and I loved it, did you go to see the animals well?
[08/12/2018, 13:46:02] John: Yeah mate, that is the kid's favourite swimming spot.
[08/12/2018, 13:46:09] John: Gotta go now, bye.
